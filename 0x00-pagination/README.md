# Pagination

Here in this project I will deep dive in to the concept of pagination and its practical implementations.

At the end of the project i am expected to be able to understand the concept and benefits of pagination, as well as get hands-on experience on best practices implementation.

- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

### Definition:

A Pagination is the process of separating print or digital content into discrete pages.

Without pagination, a simple search could return millions or even billions of hits causing extraneous network traffic.
